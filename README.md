# Contact Us Page

- This is the Contact Us page's UI, created using React.js, and basic HTML/CSS.

## Learning
- Learned about the module.css. I can apply the CSS for a particular component and it will not get overwritten with your global CSS properties even if the class names or IDs are the same. Naming conventions are like `dummy.module.css`. dummy is your file name.
- Basically, we import the CSS file as a normal 
    - ex: `import styles from "./dummy.module.css"`
- If you want to apply a particular class to a div and the same class is written in your CSS file then the syntax is `<div className={styles.yourClassName}></div>`.
